/**
 * This class allows code to check whether it should terminate for some reason, and to be notified
 * of such requests.
 *
 * <p>It works passively, the running analysis will not be interrupted directly, but instead it has
 * to check every then and now whether it should shutdown. This ensures that the running code is not
 * left in an unclean state.
 *
 * <p>The check whether a shutdown was requested is cheap and should be done quite often in order to
 * ensure a timely response to a shutdown request. As a rule of thumb, all operations that may take
 * longer than 1s should take care of calling {@link #shouldShutdown()} or {@link
 * #shutdownIfNecessary()} from time to time.
 *
 * <p>Shutdown requests cannot be issued via this class, but only via {@link ShutdownManager} to
 * allow restricting which code is allowed to request shutdowns.
 *
 * <p>Instances of this class cannot be created directly, instead create a {@link ShutdownManager}
 * and call {@link ShutdownManager#getNotifier()}.
 *
 * <p>This class is completely thread safe.
