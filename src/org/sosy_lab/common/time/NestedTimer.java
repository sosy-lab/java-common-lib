/**
 * This class represents a timer similar to {@link Timer}, however it nests two timers.
 *
 * <p>If you have a method A that calls a method B, this class can be used to measure (1) the time
 * spent by A and B together, (2) the time spent by B, and (3) the time spent only in A (without the
 * call to B). The advantage over using two separate timers is that this allows to compute average
 * and maximum of measurements for (3). A simple use of two timers would allow to compute these
 * values only for (1) and (2); for (3) one could only compute the sum time.
 *
 * <p>This class uses the name "total" to refer to measurement (1), the name "inner" to refer to
 * measurement (2), and the name "outer" to refer to measurement (3). So in general "total"
 * represents the sum of "inner" and "outer".
 *
 * <p>The "inner" timer can never be running as long as the "total" timer is not running. During a
 * single "total" interval, the "inner" timer can be started and stopped several times. This will be
 * counted only as one "inner" interval (e.g., when the average "inner" time is computed).
 * Similarly, when the "inner" timer is started and stopped several times in a single "total"
 * interval, this counts as only one "outer" interval. The number of all starts and stops of the
 * "inner" timer summed over all "outer" intervals is never used by this class and is not available
 * to the user.
 *
 * <p>This class is not thread-safe and may be used only from within a single thread.
